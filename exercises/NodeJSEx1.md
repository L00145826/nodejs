# Node.js Exercise 1 – Getting Started

## Clone the Remote Repository

This will copy some ``nodejs`` program files to your ``htdocs`` folder.  Pick one of the following two ways of downloading the repository.

### Clone by downloading ZIP file
Download [this link](https://github.com/noucampdotorgSSAD2021/nodejs/archive/main.zip).  Ensure you rename the folder downloaded as ``nodejs`` and copy this folder into your XAMPP ``htdocs`` folder.

### Clone by using git

Type these commands into your *Git Bash* client:

	```
	$ cd /<DRIVE>/xampp/htdocs   
	$ git clone https://github.com/noucampdotorgSSAD2021/nodejs.git nodejs
	$ cd nodejs
	$ dir or ls

	```

Check your ``htdocs`` folder.  You should have a new folder called ``nodejs`` with some files in it.
